We are just about to cross over into Canada. I have my passport ready for border control, although I'm not quite sure how this process will unfold. Sorry for sounding melodramatic. I'm sure its pretty try and routine. 

Afterwards we have about one and a half hours until we arrive in Toronto. Xuan wasn't able to put on her performance earlier this evening. Instead she mounted a new video piece which she showed me a photo of over WeChat. She won't be waiting for me at the gallery -- she's too wiped out from installing. Instead I'll meet her there sometime in the morning, after I arrive. I'm planning on waiting for her at a cafe nearby the gallery. That should be around 7a.m. or so.

The bus ride itself has been really wonderful actually. I've started documenting the micro-residency, as well as started to list off projects I want to work on. 

We are now being asked to disembark with all of our posessions.

I just met up with Xuan at the gallery. We caught up over lemon madelines and coffee. She showed me around the gallery, and we made tentative plans for the day.

Xuan is biking back from her apartment with more materials. While she was gone I worked on a proof-of-concept version of "sugoi oto", an instrument/installation using vocal tracks send over by Miyu Hosoi. I also got her el-wires to work so that they blink. I'm now trying to work on this workshop description, which is a lot trickier than I want it to be. For better or worse, a lot of the other issues I have to do are contingent upon me finally describing and working out this workshop. Once this groundwork is done, I'll be able to reach out to other places abroad to see if they would consider hosting the workshops as part of a residency program.

I texted my mom my address, and I'll send her Xuan's number in a bit in case she needs to call her. Hopefully when she gets back we can go out for lunch.

Xuan may have a fever from the rain. Naturally I think its my fault.

The power just came as I opened my laptop. The power went off during my shower, and we had to improvise for "You've Become a Part of Me". We have to set up for the next set now.

**22:00**

Mid second set. Lights would be nice.

**22:26**

Xuan is talking to what I imagine is some important person in the Toronto art scene. Once they're done we're going to get 24 hour pho :)
