We are just about to cross over into Canada. I have my passport ready for border control, although I'm not quite sure how this process will unfold. Sorry for sounding melodramatic. I'm sure its pretty try and routine. 

Afterwards we have about one and a half hours until we arrive in Toronto. Xuan wasn't able to put on her performance earlier this evening. Instead she mounted a new video piece which she showed me a photo of over WeChat. She won't be waiting for me at the gallery -- she's too wiped out from installing. Instead I'll meet her there sometime in the morning, after I arrive. I'm planning on waiting for her at a cafe nearby the gallery. That should be around 7a.m. or so.

The bus ride itself has been really wonderful actually. I've started documenting the micro-residency, as well as started to list off projects I want to work on. 

We are now being asked to disembark with all of our posessions.

I just met up with Xuan at the gallery. We caught up over lemon madelines and coffee. She showed me around the gallery, and we made tentative plans for the day.
